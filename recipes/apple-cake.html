    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Jewish apple cake is a must on <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/gallery/jewish-apple-cake-recipes/">Rosh Hashanah</a>, the Jewish New Year, as apples represent the hope for a sweet year ahead. Dipping them in honey (a traditional snack) and baking them into desserts sets up the year to be even sweeter. Of course, this cake would be just as delicious any time of year or any time of day. Cake for breakfast, anyone?</p>
    <p>If your family follows kosher rules (Jewish laws on food and drink that include not mixing meat and dairy in the same meal) this cake is a keeper. It's dairy-free, substituting oil for butter and orange juice for milk, and can be enjoyed with any pareve meal that has meat as the main. Serve it as a show-stopping finale to your <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/190/holidays-and-events/hanukkah/">Hanukkah meal</a>, or for a sweet midday snack with a mug of tea or coffee.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 teaspoons white sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>2 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>¼ cup orange juice</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3 medium apples - peeled, cored and sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch tube pan. Combine 5 teaspoons of the sugar and ground cinnamon together in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
      <li>Combine flour, 2 cups sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Stir in vegetable oil, beaten eggs, orange juice, and vanilla; mix until well combined.</li>
      <li>Pour 1/2 of the batter into the prepared pan. Top with 1/2 of the sliced apples and sprinkle with 1/2 of the cinnamon sugar mixture. Pour the remaining batter over the top and layer remaining sliced apples and cinnamon sugar.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 70 to 90 minutes. Cool briefly in the pan; run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
